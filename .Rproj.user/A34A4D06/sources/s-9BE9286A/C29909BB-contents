# Setting up an account

I‚Äôve made you an account and you should have already received an email about this. 
Your details are:
(user) gayan.gunaratne 
(pwd) welcome1

Please change your password using the commands ‚Äúyppasswd‚Äù and ‚Äúsmbpasswd‚Äù. You need to run both commands for the windows networks to integrate properly into blaydos. 
I would recommend setting your Blaydos password to match your windows password because it can get confusing tracking which password to use. 

We do not yet have a unified guide on using blaydos, but there are two cheat sheets we have floating about. I‚Äôve copied both in below ‚Äì expect these to be merged sometime in the future and we‚Äôll send around a link when it‚Äôs ready. 

I am happy to have a call with you to run you through usage basics and good blaydos etiquette if you would like, otherwise you also have a great team around you in WA to help out! 

The key things I need to point out are to keep an eye on the blaydos users channel in MS Teams (you will be added shortly) to check how busy everything is, if there are any current problems, etc., and to also keep an eye on storage capacity because we often run out of space, which puts everybody‚Äôs work on hold.  We need modellers to keep an eye on what they‚Äôre doing and to be proactive in archiving permanent results or removing old files as best as they can. 

Cheers,
Alex

## BLAYDOS CHEATSHEET

Blaydos key commands:
 
|Command|	Description|
|:------|-----------:|
|**General unix commands**|   |
|cd|	Change dir|
|cd ../|Go one directory up|
|mkdir|	Make a new directory|
|rm *|	Remove / delete a file|
|rm -r|	Remove a whole folder with all contents (use -rf to also stop it from asking questions)|
|ls|	List contents of directory (add -lh to make it formatted nicely for humans! ‚Äúls -lh‚Äù|
|Dir|	List the folders in the current directory|
|Df|	Show information on file system (essentially for checking file storage usage)|
|Use df -h| to make it human readable (show GB or MB instead of bytes)|
|Space_check <drive>|	Custom script that we have made to show storage usage by use on a specific drive. E.g. space_check scratch1 will reveal which users are the biggest space offenders üòä| 
|**Modelling specific**|    |
|Qstat|	Get information on currently running models in the queue (-a for human readable data)|
|freenodes|	Get information on the node usage|
|qsub|	Submit a model to the queue. Requires all files to be accessible by Blaydos!|
|tsub|	Wrapper script of qsub that will also copy files for you. Only use this for copying small files at runtime (<10mb preferably)! If you have large files that the model relies on, they should already be copied over onto blaydos somewhere.|
|   |   |
 	 
 
## Tips:
‚Ä¢	Hit ‚ÄúTAB‚Äù once for auto-completion (i.e. start writing a folder name and pressing TAB will autocomplete it for you)
‚Ä¢	When you‚Äôre using cd to move to a new directory, you can double press ‚ÄúTAB‚Äù key to get a list of the current folders inside the directory which can help you decide where to go
 
Your Home Drive (/home/<username>)
Every user on Blaydos has a home drive (‚Äúcd ~‚Äù or ‚Äúcd /home/Kabir.suara‚Äù). You can store small files on here (e.g. commonly used scripts, python project directories, etc.). Do not store large files here. Every user can access every other user‚Äôs home drive, so don‚Äôt store sensitive info there (although no one will really look in these folders). 
 
Network Drives
Drive	What we use it for
Spare	This is where we put our large modelling files for a project. E.g. if you‚Äôre running a TUFLOWFV model that has a 20gb boundary condition, all these BC‚Äôs should live on spare/projects/<proj_num>/<whatever structure you want>
Generally we copy the folder structure that we have on our own network drives on spare to keep things simple. 
Scratch1/Scratch2	This is where we write our modelling results to. These are big drives that the blaydos nodes can access quickly so they‚Äôre perfecft for writing results on. Generally we use the following structure: /scratch1/<proj_number>/<model_type>/output
/mnt/coastal
/mnt/catchments
/mnt/oceanics	These are network mounts to our Brisbane Drives. Use these to access files on the Brisbane server, but only use it for small files (e.g. model text files). All big files you need should be on Blaydos (spare drive, etc.) 
/arc1/	Our long-term storage archive. You can store FINAL model results on here if they need to be kept. Don‚Äôt use this drive for working on during a project, it is intended as a cold storage drive. It‚Äôs not particularly fast to access compared to the scratch drives.
 
It is every user‚Äôs responsibly to clean up their projects when they can. We unfortunately run out of space quite often on Blaydos due to the nature of modelling (we make lots of data quickly‚Ä¶) so please try and delete or move files whenever possible. 
 
Running models
We have two commonly used copies of TUFLOW FV on blaydos. These can be accessed by calling ‚Äútuflowfv_trunk‚Äù or ‚Äútuflowfv_dev‚Äù. They are used in the same fashion that tuflow_fv is normally called, however you‚Äôd typically call it from a PBS script. 
 
A PBS script is similar to a .sh (or .bat) file that is used to submit a model to a queue. 
 
General format as follows (e.g. ‚Äúrun_model.pbs‚Äù):
 
#PBS -M alexander.waterhouse@bmtglobal.com   - Put your email here to get a good or bad news email when your model has finished or crashed
#PBS -m aeb   
#PBS -N GladAlpha_diff_v5_q5   - This is the name that will show up on ‚Äúqstat‚Äù. 
#PBS -l walltime=200:00:00   
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=16   - Set this to the number of cores you want to use. Generally we use the max available (‚Äúfreenodes‚Äù to see the max available)
#PBS -q batch    - Set this to the queue you want to submit to (‚Äúmurali‚Äù, ‚Äúbatch‚Äù, ‚Äúfast‚Äù, sometimes ‚Äúspecial‚Äù)
 
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$PBS_NUM_PPN
ulimit -s unlimited
 
tuflowfv_trunk diffuser_v5_Jun2020_Jul2020_OricaAlt.fvc   - PUT YOUR MODELS HERE
 
 
More Tips 
Blaydos Notes:
IP Address:
\\10.59.66.10
 
Space on Blaydos disks
Check space over all the drives
df -h
 
Check who's data is on a particular disk
space_check /scratch3/
 
Check where your data is sitting on a disk
space_check/scratch3/  mitchell.baum
 
 
Live update of script output
watch -n 5 tail /filepath to log file
The 5 denotes the refresh rate in seconds
Ctrl + c to exit

Multiple screen instances on MobaXterm - Blaydos
New screen session of Blaydos associated with your account
screen -S name1
 
To exit the screen (attach, then detatch)
Ctrl + a, Ctrl + d
 
To see what screens you have open
screen -ls
 
To re-enter an existing screen
screen -r name1
 
To close an existing screen
Switch to screen you wish to remove
Ctrl + d
 
 
Model runs in Blaydos
If files are located on Blaydos already
qsub <model run .pbs file>
 
If files are located on L: or P: drive (only works for TFV files)
tsub <model run .pbs file>
 
Note: tsub is a wrapper function that copies files from network drive to the Blaydos tmpdir and submits the job. It should also copy the log files back to the network drive once finished.
 
Cancel a model run
qdel <model run ID>
 
Note: You can only cancel your own jobs.
 
Pause a model run
pause_job.sh <model run ID>
 
Resume a model run after pausing
resume_job.sh <model run ID>
 
 
MATLAB on Blaydos
matlab -nodisplay
OR
matlab &
 
For -nodisplay, it's easiest to navigate to directory containing your script and run by entering the script name.
Edit in text editor and run in MobaXterm
 
exit to exit and resume to terminal input
 
Check MATLAB install: which matlab
 
Check MATLAB version: ls -lh <directory from which matlab output>
 
 
Running on Murali
Note: generally 4-5 √ó slower than Blaydos. Get in touch with Toby first to request a few nodes to be turned on. Generally turned off to save power.
 
Changes to PBS file:
#PBS -q batch
to:
#PBS -q murali
 
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=16
to:
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=8
 
 
Available Nodes
Provides output that summarises availability of nodes on Blaydos, Murali and Silver
 
freenodes
 
 
Designate Node for Run
Allows flexibility in designating nodes to allocate runs to, and can also allow you to define how many cores to split up the run on. For example, using this method you can submit two individual runs to the same node, to run in parallel, each with 8 cores. Can also be useful to queue runs to a particular node if nodes are at a premium.
 
Changes to PBS file:
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=16
to:
#PBS -l nodes=node10:ppn=16
 
Delete folders/files with numeric values within a certain range
rm -r [1-9]*
 
Query file sizes in directory
ls -l -h
