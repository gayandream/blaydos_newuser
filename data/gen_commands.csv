Space_check,Custom script that we have made to show storage usage by use on a specific drive. Ex; space_check /scratch1/ will reveal which users are the biggest space offenders
du,"disk usage. Very helpful command to help you see the size of an entire folder tree in linux. Ex: If you have a big project, you could navigate to it, and type ""du -h"" and it will list all the subfolders and how much space is used in them. "
du -h -d 1,"you can use du to look at things across a whole bunch of projects 
Ex; for a list of the disk usage on all of the scratch1 projects, you could  type ""du -h -d 1 /scratch1"" (-d  1, depth 1 means it only tells you the top folder size). "
